# Archi Docker Image
Archi (https://www.archimatetool.com), Phillip Beauvoir's amazing Open-Source Archimate modelling tool, can be run from the command line. This docker container allows you to run it in Docker.

The documentation for the Archimate command line tool can be found here: https://github.com/archimatetool/archi/wiki/Archi-Command-Line-Interface

This allows Archimate to be run in Gitlab CI/CD or Jenkins, e.g. to export the model to CSV or generate a report every time a model is changed in Git and allows to transfer reports in many protocol with lftp.
